## What is SwiftAgent?
In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving tech landscape, AI agents have moved far beyond experimental researchâ€”they are now set to become an integral part of everyday development. Agentic systems are not just about early-stage prototypes; theyâ€™re about delivering robust, production-grade solutions that power real-world applications. SwiftAgent is the pioneering, scalable agent framework that transforms this vision into reality. It provides developers with an out-of-the-box, production-ready infrastructure that meets the demands of modern enterprise environments, ensuring high performance and seamless integration from concept to deployment.


## Installation

```bash
pip install swiftagent
```

## Getting Started

Let's build a real-time Weather Agent!

### Step 1: Install dependencies

We rely on the `python_weather` package to get real time weather for a city, so download it using

```bash
python -m pip install python_weather
```

### Step 2: Create an Agent Instance

Start by importing and instantiating a SwiftAgent.

```python
from swiftagent import SwiftAgent
import python_weather # for later action
import asyncio # for running async functions directly

weather_agent = SwiftAgent(name="WeatherAgent")
```

### Step 3: Define Actions

Actions are the core functionality of your agent, providing external abilities to agents. Use the `@SwiftAgent.action` decorator around any function to define what your agent can do:

```python
@weather_agent.action(description="get weather for a city")
async def get_weather_for_city(city: str) -> None:
    async with python_weather.Client(unit=python_weather.IMPERIAL) as client:
        weather = await client.get(city)
        return weather.temperature
```

### Step 4: Run the Agent

Agents are asynchronous since it allows for high scalability and performance. To directly run an asynchronous function, we use the built-in Python `asyncio` module.

```python
async def main():
    await agent.run('What is the weather in boston?')

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Agents are the core of any agentic system, representing a (semi-)autonomous unit that is capable of reasoning and taking actions to accomplish a goal. Agents are capable of using actions, having memory, and utilizing reasoning patterns.

### Actions

Actions are utilities or functionalities that an agent can perform. Much like we carry out everyday tasks â€” such as walking, talking, or using a computerâ€”agents can execute actions like checking the weather, writing a Google Doc, or retrieving current stock prices.

SwiftAgent provides two primary methods to define actions:

---

#### 1. Using the `SwiftAgent.action` Decorator

This method allows you to register an action directly by decorating a function with the agent's own `action` decorator. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
from swiftagent import SwiftAgent

# Initialize your agent
agent = SwiftAgent()

# Define and register an action using the agent's decorator
@agent.action(description="Description her")
def sample_action(param1: str):
    # Implementation of your action here
    pass
```

---

#### 2. Using the Standalone `action` Decorator with `add_action`

Alternatively, you can create an action using the standalone `action` decorator and then register it with your agent by calling the `add_action` method. This approach offers flexibility, especially if you prefer to separate the action definition from the agent's configuration, or want to create reusable actions.

```python
from swiftagent import SwiftAgent
from swiftagent.actions import action

# Initialize your agent
agent = SwiftAgent()

# Define the action using the standalone decorator
@action(description="Description here")
def sample_action(param1: str):
    # Implementation of your action here
    pass

# Add the action to your agent
agent.add_action(sample_action)
```

---

Both methods are fully supported in SwiftAgent! 

### Persistence & State

A key differentiator of SwiftAgent is that it's agents by default are capable of being both persistent and stateful out of the box.

### Multi Agent Collaboration

SwiftAgent also features SwiftSuites,
